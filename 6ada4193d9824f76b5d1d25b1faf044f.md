Building 64-bit Systems for Raspberry Pi 4 with Yocto

This post is about building 64-bit Linux systems for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) 4 boards using software from the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/).

Yocto is a set of tools for building a custom embedded Linux distribution. The systems are usually targeted for a particular application such as a commercial product.

Yocto uses what it calls **meta-layers** to define the configuration. Within each meta-layer are recipes, classes and configuration files that support the primary build tool, a python app called **bitbake**.

I have a custom meta-layer for the RPi4 boards called [meta-rpi64](https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi64).

There are a some example images in [meta-rpi64](https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi64) that I have been experimenting with.

These systems use **sysvinit**, but Yocto supports **systemd**.

The systems support both QWidget and QML [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) applications using the [eglfs](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/embedded-linux.html) backend, useful for dedicated full-screen applications that do not require a window manager.

### Downloads

If you want a quick look at the resulting systems, you can download some pre-built images [here](https://jumpnowtek.com/downloads/rpi64/).

Instructions for installing onto an SD card are in the [README](https://jumpnowtek.com/downloads/rpi64/README.txt).

The login user is **root** with password **jumpnowtek**.

You will be prompted to change the password on first login.

The systems are setup to use a serial console. A dhcp client will run on the ethernet interface and an ssh server is running.

**Note:** There is a firewall rule that will lock out your IP for 2 minutes after 5 failed logins.

### System Info

The Yocto version is **3.0**, the `[zeus]` branch.

The **4.19** Linux kernel comes from the [github.com/raspberrypi/linux](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux) repository.

These are **sysvinit** systems using [eudev](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Eudev).

The Qt version is **5.13.2** There is no **X11** and no desktop installed. [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) GUI applications can be run fullscreen using one of the \[Qt embedded linux plugins\]\[embedded-linux-qpa\] like **eglfs** or **linuxfb**, both are provided. The default is **eglfs**.

Python **3.7.6** with a number of modules is included.

gcc/g++ **9.2.0** and associated build tools are installed.

git **2.23.1** is installed.

wireguard **20191219** is installed.

### Ubuntu Setup

I am using **18.04** 64-bit servers for builds. Other versions should work.

You will need at least the following packages installed

```
build-essential
chrpath
diffstat
gawk
libncurses5-dev
python3-distutils
texinfo

```

For **18.04** you also need to install the **python 2.7** package

And then create some links for it in `/usr/bin`

```
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python2

```

For all versions of Ubuntu, you should change the default Ubuntu shell from **dash** to **bash** by running this command from a shell

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

```

Choose **No** to dash when prompted.

### Clone the dependency repositories

For all upstream repositories, use the `[zeus]` branch.

The directory layout I am describing here is my preference. All of the paths to the meta-layers are configurable. If you choose something different, adjust the following instructions accordingly.

First the main Yocto project **poky** layer

```
~$ git clone -b zeus git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git poky-zeus

```

Then the dependency layers under that

```
~$ cd poky-zeus
~/poky-zeus$ git clone -b zeus git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
~/poky-zeus$ git clone -b zeus https://github.com/meta-qt5/meta-qt5
~/poky-zeus$ git clone -b zeus git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
~/poky-zeus$ git clone -b zeus git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security.git

```

And my own common meta-layer that changes some upstream package defaults and adds a few custom recipes.

```
~/poky-zeus$ git clone -b zeus https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-jumpnow

```

### Clone the meta-rpi repository

Create a separate sub-directory for the **meta-rpi64** repository before cloning. This is where you will be doing your customization.

```
~$ mkdir ~/rpi64
~$ cd ~/rpi64
~/rpi64$ git clone -b zeus git://github.com/jumpnow/meta-rpi64

```

The `meta-rpi64/README.md` file has the last commits from the dependency repositories that I tested. You can always checkout those commits explicitly if you run into problems.

### Initialize the build directory

Again much of the following are only my conventions.

Choose a build directory. I tend to do this on a per board and/or per project basis so I can quickly switch between projects. For this example I’ll put the build directory under `~/rpi64/` with the `meta-rpi64` layer.

You could manually create the directory structure like this

```
$ mkdir -p ~/rpi64/build/conf

```

Or you could use the Yocto environment script **oe-init-build-env** like this passing in the path to the build directory

```
~$ source poky-zeus/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi64/build

```

The Yocto environment script will create the build directory if it does not already exist.

### Customize the configuration files

There are some sample configuration files in the **meta-rpi/conf** directory.

Copy them to the **build/conf** directory (removing the ‘-sample’)

```
~/rpi64$ cp meta-rpi64/conf/local.conf.sample build/conf/local.conf
~/rpi64$ cp meta-rpi64/conf/bblayers.conf.sample build/conf/bblayers.conf

```

If you used the **oe-init-build-env** script to create the build directory, it generated some generic configuration files in the **build/conf** directory. If you want to look at them, save them with a different name before overwriting.

It is not necessary, but you may want to customize the configuration files before your first build.

**Warning:** Do not use the ‘**~**’ character when defining directory paths in the Yocto configuration files.

### Edit bblayers.conf

In **bblayers.conf** file replace **${HOME}** with the appropriate path to the meta-layer repositories on your system if you modified any of the paths in the previous instructions.

**WARNING:** Do not include **meta-yocto-bsp** in your **bblayers.conf**. The Yocto BSP requirements for the Raspberry Pi are in **meta-raspberrypi**.

For example, if your directory structure does not look exactly like this, you will need to modify `bblayers.conf`

```
~/poky-zeus/
    meta-jumpnow/
    meta-openembedded/
    meta-qt5/
    meta-raspberrypi
    ...

~/rpi64/
    meta-rpi64/
    build/
        conf/

```

### Edit local.conf

The variables you may want to customize are the following:

*   MACHINE
*   TMPDIR
*   DL_DIR
*   SSTATE_DIR

The defaults for all of these work fine with the exception of **MACHINE**.

##### MACHINE

The **MACHINE** variable is used to determine the target architecture and various compiler tuning flags.

See the conf files under `meta-raspberrypi/conf/machine` for details.

The only choice for **MACHINE** that I have tested is **raspberrypi4**.

I think **raspberrypi3** should work as well, but I have not tried.

##### TMPDIR

This is where temporary build files and the final build binaries will end up. Expect to use around **20GB**.

The default location is under the **build** directory, in this example **~/rpi64/build/tmp**.

If you specify an alternate location as I do in the example conf file make sure the directory is writable by the user running the build.

##### DL_DIR

This is where the downloaded source files will be stored. You can share this among configurations and builds so I always create a general location for this outside the project directory. Make sure the build user has write permission to the directory you decide on.

The default location is in the **build** directory, **~/rpi64/build/sources**.

##### SSTATE_DIR

This is another Yocto build directory that can get pretty big, greater then **4GB**. I often put this somewhere else other then my home directory as well.

The default location is in the **build** directory, **~/rpi64/build/sstate-cache**.

#### ROOT PASSWORD

There is only one login user by default, **root**.

The default password is set to **jumpnowtek** by these two lines in the **local.conf** file

```
INHERIT += "extrausers"
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -P jumpnowtek root; "

```

These two lines force a password change on first login

```
INHERIT += "chageusers"
CHAGE_USERS_PARAMS = "chage -d0 root; "

```

You can comment them out if you do not want that behavior.

If you want no password at all (development only hopefully), comment those four lines and uncomment this line

```
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"

#INHERIT += "extrausers"
#EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -P jumpnowtek root; "

#INHERIT += "chageusers"
#CHAGE_USERS_PARAMS = "chage -d0 root; "

```

You can always add or change the password once logged in.

### Run the build

You need to [source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4779756/what-is-the-difference-between-source-script-sh-and-script-sh) the Yocto environment into your shell before you can use [bitbake](http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual.html). The **oe-init-build-env** will not overwrite your customized conf files.

```
~$ source poky-zeus/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi64/build

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks

~/rpi/build$

```

I don’t use any of those _Common targets_, but instead always write my own custom image recipes.

The **meta-rpi64** layer has some examples under **meta-rpi64/images/** with a lot of the details coming from the **meta-jumpnow/images/basic-dev-image.bb** recipe.

### Build

To build the **console-image** run the following command

```
~/rpi64/build$ bitbake console-image

```

You may occasionally run into build errors related to packages that either failed to download or sometimes out of order builds. The easy solution is to clean the failed package and rerun the build again.

For instance if the build for **zip** failed for some reason, I would run this

```
~/rpi64/build$ bitbake -c cleansstate zip
~/rpi64/build$ bitbake zip

```

And then continue with the full build.

```
~/rpi64/build$ bitbake console-image

```

To build the `qt5-image` it would be

```
~/rpi64/build$ bitbake qt5-image

```

The **cleansstate** command (with two s’s) works for image recipes as well.

The image files won’t get deleted from the **TMPDIR** until the next time you build.

### Copying the binaries to an SD card (or eMMC)

After the build completes, the bootloader, kernel and rootfs image files can be found in **/deploy/images/$MACHINE** with \*\*MACHINE\*\* coming from your \*\*local.conf\*\*.

The **meta-rpi64/scripts** directory has some helper scripts to format and copy the files to a microSD card.

#### mk2parts.sh

This script will partition an SD card with the minimal 2 partitions required for the RPI.

Insert the microSD into your workstation and note where it shows up.

[lsblk](http://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk) is convenient for finding the microSD card.

For example

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0    7:0    0  16.9M  1 loop /snap/aws-cli/151
loop1    7:1    0  91.4M  1 loop /snap/core/8689
loop2    7:2    0  10.3M  1 loop /snap/doctl/281
loop3    7:3    0  10.3M  1 loop /snap/doctl/276
loop4    7:4    0  91.3M  1 loop /snap/core/8592
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0     1M  0 part 
├─sda2   8:2    0   150G  0 part /
├─sda3   8:3    0   200G  0 part /src
├─sda4   8:4    0   200G  0 part /home
├─sda5   8:5    0   120G  0 part /oe5
├─sda6   8:6    0   120G  0 part /oe6
└─sda7   8:7    0 141.5G  0 part /oe7
sdb      8:16   0 447.1G  0 disk 
├─sdb1   8:17   0   150G  0 part /oe8
├─sdb2   8:18   0   150G  0 part /oe9
└─sdb3   8:19   0 147.1G  0 part /oe10
sdc      8:32   1   7.4G  0 disk 
├─sdc1   8:33   1    64M  0 part 
└─sdc2   8:34   1     7.3G  0 part 

```

So I will use **sdc** for the card on this machine.

It doesn’t matter if some partitions from the SD card are mounted. The **mk2parts.sh** script will unmount them.

**WARNING**: This script will format any disk on your workstation so make sure you choose the SD card.

The script tries to protect against accidents by not running against any device that has partitions currently mounted.

```
~$ cd ~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ sudo ./mk2parts.sh sdc

```

You only have to format the SD card once.

#### Temporary mount point

You will need to create a mount point on your workstation for the copy scripts to use.

This is the default

```
~$ sudo mkdir /media/card

```

You only have to create this directory once.

If you don’t want that location, you will have to edit the following scripts to use the mount point you choose.

#### copy_boot.sh

This script copies the GPU firmware, the Linux kernel, dtbs and overlays, config.txt and cmdline.txt to the boot partition of the SD card.

This **copy_boot.sh** script needs to know the **TMPDIR** to find the binaries.

If you use the directory structure described above, the script should figure this out on its own.

If not it looks for an environment variable called **OETMP**.

For instance, if I had this in `build/conf/local.conf`

```
TMPDIR = "/oe8/rpi64/tmp-zeus"

```

Then I would export this environment variable before running `copy_boot.sh`

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ export OETMP=/oe8/rpi64/tmp-zeus

```

If you didn’t override the default **TMPDIR** in `local.conf`, then set it to the default **TMPDIR**

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ export OETMP=~/rpi64/build/tmp

```

The `copy_boot.sh` script also needs a **MACHINE** environment variable specifying the type of RPi board.

Again the script will attempt to figure this out, but if not you can specify with an environment variable.

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ export MACHINE=raspberrypi4

```

Then run the **copy_boot.sh** script passing the location of SD card

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ ./copy_boot.sh sdc

```

This script should run very fast.

If you want to customize the **config.txt** or **cmdline.txt** files for the system, you can place either of those files in the **meta-rpi64/scripts** directory and the **copy_boot.sh** script will copy them as well.

Take a look at the script if this is unclear.

#### copy_rootfs.sh

This script copies the root file system to the second partition of the SD card.

The **copy_rootfs.sh** script needs the same **OETMP** and **MACHINE** environment variables.

The script accepts an optional command line argument for the image type, for example **console** or **qt5**. The default is **console** if no argument is provided.

The script also accepts a **hostname** argument if you want the host name to be something other then the default **MACHINE**.

Here’s an example of how you would run **copy_rootfs.sh**

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ ./copy_rootfs.sh sdc console

```

or

```
~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ ./copy_rootfs.sh sdc qt5 rpi4

```

The **copy_rootfs.sh** script will take longer to run and depends a lot on the quality of your SD card. With a good **Class 10** card it should take less then 30 seconds.

The copy scripts will **NOT** unmount partitions automatically. If an SD card partition is already mounted, the script will complain and abort. This is for safety, mine mostly, since I run these scripts many times a day on different machines and the SD cards show up in different places.

Here is an example session copying the console-image system to an SD card already partitioned.

```
~$ cd rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts

~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ ./copy_boot.sh sdc

OETMP: /oe8/rpi64/tmp-zeus

~/rpi64/meta-rpi64/scripts$ ./copy_rootfs.sh sdc

```

Both **copy_boot.sh** and **copy_rootfs.sh** are simple scripts, easily customized.

#### Some custom package examples

[spiloop](https://github.com/scottellis/spiloop) is a **spidev** test application.

The **bitbake recipe** that builds and packages **spiloop** is here

```
meta-jumpnow/recipes-misc/spiloop/spiloop_git.bb

```

Use it to test the **spidev** driver before and after placing a jumper between pins the SPI data pins.

[tspress](https://github.com/scottellis/tspress) is a Qt5 QWidget application installed with the `qt5-image`. I use it for testing touchscreens.

The recipe is here and can be used a guide for your own applications.

```
meta-rpi64/recipes-qt/tspress/tspress_git.bb

```

[qmlswipe](https://github.com/scottellis/qmlswipe) is a Qt5 QML application installed with the `qt5-image`. Again just for basic testing.

The recipe is here and can be used a guide for your own applications.

```
meta-rpi64/recipes-qt/qmlswipe/qmlswipe_git.bb

```

#### Adding additional packages

To display the list of available recipes from the **meta-layers** included in **bblayers.conf**

```
~$ source poky-zeus/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi64/build

~/rpi64/build$ bitbake -s

```

Once you have the recipe name, you need to find what packages the recipe produces. Use the **oe-pkgdata-util** utility for this.

For instance, to see the packages produced by the **openssh** recipe

```
~/rpi64/build$ oe-pkgdata-util list-pkgs -p openssh
openssh-keygen
openssh-scp
openssh-ssh
openssh-sshd
openssh-sftp
openssh-misc
openssh-sftp-server
openssh-dbg
openssh-dev
openssh-doc
openssh

```

These are the individual packages you could add to your image recipe.

You can also use **oe-pkgdata-util** to check the individual files a package will install.

For instance, to see the files for the **openssh-sshd** package

```
~/rpi64/build$ oe-pkgdata-util list-pkg-files openssh-sshd
openssh-sshd:
        /etc/default/volatiles/99_sshd
        /etc/init.d/sshd
        /etc/ssh/moduli
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config_readonly
        /usr/libexec/openssh/sshd_check_keys
        /usr/sbin/sshd

```

For a package to be installed in your image it has to get into the **IMAGE_INSTALL** variable some way or another. See the example image recipes for some common conventions.
