memory overcommit

This is an [answer](https://serverfault.com/questions/606185/how-does-vm-overcommit-memory-work) from serverfault.

You can find the documentation in [`man 5 proc`](https://manned.org/proc) ([or at kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting)):

The simple answer is that setting overcommit to 1, will set the stage so that when a program calls something like `malloc()` to allocate a chunk of memory (`man 3 malloc`), it will always succeed regardless if the system knows it will not have all the memory that is being asked for.

The underlying concept to understand is the idea of _virtual memory_. Programs see a virtual address space that may, or may not, be mapped to actual physical memory. By disabling overcommit checking, you tell the OS to just assume that there is always enough physical memory to backup the virtual space.

### Example

To highlight why this can sometimes matter, take a look at the [Redis guidances](https://redis.io/topics/faq#background-saving-fails-with-a-fork-error-under-linux-even-if-i-have-a-lot-of-free-ram) on why `vm.overcommit_memory` should be set to 1 for it.
