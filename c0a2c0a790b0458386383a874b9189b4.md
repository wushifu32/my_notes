body_diff: "@@ -0,0 +1,3125 @@\n+# Welcome to Joplin! %F0%9F%97%92%EF%B8%8F%0A%0AJoplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which helps you write and organise your notes, and synchronise them between your devices. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in %5BMarkdown format%5D(https://joplinapp.org/#markdown). Joplin is available as a **%F0%9F%92%BB desktop**, **%F0%9F%93%B1 mobile** and **%F0%9F%94%A1 terminal** application.%0A%0AThe notes in this notebook give an overview of what Joplin can do and how to use it. In general, the three applications share roughly the same functionalities; any differences will be clearly indicated.%0A%0A!%5B%5D(:/ea001679b2e04f1cbd35e59f187af65f)%0A%0A## Joplin is divided into three parts%0A%0AJoplin has three main columns:%0A%0A- **Sidebar** contains the list of your notebooks and tags, as well as the synchronisation status.%0A- **Note List** contains the current list of notes - either the notes in the currently selected notebook, the notes in the currently selected tag, or search results.%0A- **Note Editor** is the place where you write your notes in Markdown, with a viewer showing what the note will look like. You may also use an %5Bexternal editor%5D(https://joplinapp.org/#external-text-editor) to edit notes. For example, if you like WYSIWYG editors, you can use something like Typora as an external editor and it will display the note as well as any embedded images.%0A%0A## Writing notes in Markdown%0A%0AMarkdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Joplin supports a %5BGithub-flavoured Markdown syntax%5D(https://joplinapp.org/markdown/) with a few variations and additions.%0A%0AIn general, while Markdown is a markup language, it is meant to be human readable, even without being rendered. This is a simple example (you can see how it looks in the viewer panel):%0A%0A* * *%0A%0A# Heading%0A%0A## Sub-heading%0A%0AParagraphs are separated by a blank line. Text attributes _italic_, **bold** and %60monospace%60 are supported. You can create bullet lists:%0A%0A* apples%0A* oranges%0A* pears%0A%0AOr numbered lists:%0A%0A1. wash%0A2. rinse%0A3. repeat%0A%0AThis is a %5Blink%5D(https://joplinapp.org) and, finally, below is a horizontal rule:%0A%0A* * *%0A%0AA lot more is possible including adding code samples, math formulae or checkbox lists - see the %5BMarkdown documentation%5D(https://joplinapp.org/#markdown) for more information.%0A%0A## Organising your notes%0A%0A### With notebooks %F0%9F%93%94%0A%0AJoplin notes are organised into a tree of notebooks and sub-notebooks.%0A%0A- On **desktop**, you can create a notebook by clicking on New Notebook, then you can drag and drop them into other notebooks to organise them as you wish.%0A- On **mobile**, press the %22+%22 icon and select %22New notebook%22.%0A- On **terminal**, press %60:mn%60%0A%0A!%5B%5D(:/b5bd2f45929940c1915ca9ce655fa62b)%0A%0A### With tags %F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%0A%0AThe second way to organise your notes is using tags:%0A%0A- On **desktop**, right-click on any note in the Note List, and select %22Edit tags%22. You can then add the tags, separating them by commas.%0A- On **mobile**, open the note and press the %22%E2%8B%AE%22 button and select %22Tags%22.%0A- On **terminal**, type %60:help tag%60 for the available commands.%0A\n"
