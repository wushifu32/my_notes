vmalloc

The code of `vmalloc` is on `mm/vmalloc.c`
The main data is `struct vm_struct` & `struct vmap_area`
Like the `struct vm_area_struct` in user space, the vm_struct is listed in a global list named `vmlist`.
The address space of vmalloc is managed by 2 global red-black tree constructed by vmap_areaS named `free_vmap_area_root` & `vmap_area_root`. As the code comment, the tree recorded the address region of vmalloc:
```c
 /*
 * All vmap_area objects in this tree are sorted by va->va_start
 * address. It is used for allocation and merging when a vmap
 * object is released.
 *
 * Each vmap_area node contains a maximum available free block
 * of its sub-tree, right or left. Therefore it is possible to
 * find a lowest match of free area.
 */
```
As for the physic pages are managed by vm_struct:
```c
struct vm_struct {
	struct vm_struct	*next;
	void			*addr;
	unsigned long		size;
	unsigned long		flags;
	struct page		**pages;
	unsigned int		nr_pages;
	phys_addr_t		phys_addr;
	const void		*caller;
};
```
The addr of vm_struct is the virtual address will return from `vmalloc` to the caller. While vmalloc has seperate physic pages, so here is a array of pages belong to this vmalloc region.
After read the code. We know there are 2 things to deal with when vmalloc is been called:
* Find a block of virtual address of vmalloc from the vmap_area rbtree. (`__get_vm_area_node` handle this)
* Request pages from buddy allocator and make the page table mapping physic pages to continuous virtual address. (`__vmalloc_area_node` handle this)

### Find the Virtual Address
The key function is `alloc_vmap_area`. Find the lowest address match in `free_vmap_area_root` and update the free region by `adjust_va_to_fit_type` function.
```c
struct vmap_area {
	unsigned long va_start;
	unsigned long va_end;

	struct rb_node rb_node;         /* address sorted rbtree */
	struct list_head list;          /* address sorted list */

	/*
	 * The following three variables can be packed, because
	 * a vmap_area object is always one of the three states:
	 *    1) in "free" tree (root is vmap_area_root)
	 *    2) in "busy" tree (root is free_vmap_area_root)
	 *    3) in purge list  (head is vmap_purge_list)
	 */
	union {
		unsigned long subtree_max_size; /* in "free" tree */
		struct vm_struct *vm;           /* in "busy" tree */
		struct llist_node purge_list;   /* in purge list */
	};
};
```
