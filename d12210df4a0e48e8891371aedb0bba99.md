How does the OOM killer decide which process to kill first?

If memory is exhaustively used up by processes, to the extent which can possibly threaten the stability of the system, then the OOM killer comes into the picture.

**NOTE:** It is the task of the OOM Killer to continue killing processes until enough memory is freed for the smooth functioning of the rest of the process that the Kernel is attempting to run.

The OOM Killer has to select the **best** process(es) to kill. **Best** here refers to that process which will free up the maximum memory upon killing and is also the least important to the system.

The primary goal is to kill the least number of processes that minimizes the damage done and at the same time maximizing the amount of memory freed.

To facilitate this, the kernel maintains an `oom_score` for each of the processes. You can see the `oom_score` of each of the processes in the `/proc` filesystem under the `pid` directory.

```
$ cat /proc/10292/oom_score

```

The higher the value of `oom_score` of any process, the higher is its likelihood of getting killed by the _OOM Killer_ in an out-of-memory situation.

### How is the `OOM_Score` calculated?

> In David's patch set, the old badness() heuristics are almost entirely gone. Instead, the calculation turns into a simple question of what percentage of the available memory is being used by the process. If the system as a whole is short of memory, then "available memory" is the sum of all RAM and swap space available to the system.

A similar calculation is made if limits imposed by a memory policy have been exceeded. In each case, the memory use of the process is deemed to be the sum of its resident set (the number of RAM pages it is using) and its swap usage.

There are very few heuristic tweaks to this score, but the code does still subtract a small amount (30) from the score of root-owned processes on the notion that they are slightly more valuable than user-owned processes.

This knob allows the adjustment of each process's attractiveness to the OOM killer in user space; setting it to -1000 will disable OOM kills entirely, while setting to +1000 is the equivalent of painting a large target on the associated process.
